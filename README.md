# ErcNftMetadataParser

## Description

A gas-optimized NFT marketplace contract utilizing Merkle tree-based whitelisting and on-chain SVG generation for dynamic metadata updates, minimizing reliance on external oracles.

## Features

- Extract NFT metadata from ERC-721 and ERC-1155 tokens across multiple EVM-compatible chains by parsing contract storage.
- Implement a caching mechanism using Redis to reduce redundant on-chain data retrieval and improve response times.
- Support dynamic metadata resolution by executing custom JavaScript sandboxed environments to evaluate SVG and JSON-based metadata.
- Validate metadata integrity by comparing the hash of the resolved metadata against a pre-computed hash stored on-chain or in a trusted registry.
- Provide a GraphQL API endpoint for querying NFT metadata, including filtering and sorting options based on metadata attributes.
- Integrate with IPFS gateways to retrieve off-chain metadata stored using content addressing.
- Develop a plugin architecture allowing users to extend metadata parsing capabilities with custom decoders for specific NFT projects.
- Implement rate limiting and request throttling to prevent abuse and ensure service availability.
